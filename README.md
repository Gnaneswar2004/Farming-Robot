# Farming-Robot
This project presents a mechanized farming system to address labor shortages and inefficiencies in Indian agriculture. A robot automates tasks like ploughing, seed sowing, and precise fertilizer spraying, reducing waste and promoting sustainability. It enables farmers to boost yields, cut costs, and secure a sustainable future.
